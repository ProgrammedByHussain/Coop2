        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my co-op experience website! I am now in my third year of
          Computer Science and on this website, I share the highlights of my
          second work term. I stayed at the same placement as my previous term,
          but I was given the opportunity to collaborate with another individual
          at the Co-op named Andrew. The main theme of this semester was
          perseverance and collaboration.
        </p>

      <!-- Information about the Employer -->
      <section id="employer" class="mt-5">
        <h2>Employer</h2>
        <img
          src="ORS Banner.png"
          alt="Office of Registrarial Services"
          class="img-fluid mb-3"
        />
        <p>
          I was employed again at the registrar's office on the 3rd floor of the
          university centre. I worked in the scheduling department under my
          supervisor Tammy, and as previously mentioned, there was another
          student with me this time. I was grateful to be at the University
          again as it is a place that feels like a home away from home. One
          thing I need to mention is that I was given this co-op placement
          originally in the summer as part of the president's Co-op initiative.
          Thus, I appreciate my employer allowing me to have this opportunity in
          the first place. I was brought back under an official co-op placement
          for the fall, but I wouldn’t have even been given this opportunity to
          come back if it weren’t for the initial initiative.
        </p>

      <!-- Goals -->
      <section id="goals" class="mt-5">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
          My goals for this work term focused on enhancing my teamwork,
          quantitative literacy, critical thinking, and written communication
          skills. I aimed to collaborate effectively with my co-op partner,
          Andrew, quantify the impact of my work to demonstrate its value,
          thoroughly understand tasks by asking questions, and produce clear and
          comprehensive documentation. I create these goals to improve my job
          performance and prepare me for future opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          I developed specific goals relating to my job tasks, such as dividing
          responsibilities with my co-op partner based on our strengths,
          allowing one of us to take the lead when we see fit. Additionally, I
          set goals to quantify my work outcomes and track the measurable
          effects of my contributions. I also wanted to improve my communication
          skills through documentation and ensure a deep understanding of tasks
          by actively clarifying expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflecting on my goals, I improved my teamwork and written
          communication skills and gained a better understanding of quantifying
          my work's impact. Myself and Andrew were in contact a lot of the time,
          as we were working remotely for several days, and this emphasis on
          improving communication allowed us to do well regardless of not being
          in the same place. We made sure to ask questions when we needed help,
          including the team at Infosilem. However, I could further improve my
          ability to fully quantify my contributions, as this requires more
          practice and experience. Overall, these outcomes have created a strong
          foundation for my future growth.

      <!-- Job Description -->
      <section id="job-description" class="mt-5">
        <h2>Job</h2>
        <p>
          During my previous co-op placement, I worked as a Scheduling Systems
          Support alongside my co-op partner, Andrew, under the supervision of
          Tammy. My responsibilities varied widely, including both physical
          tasks, such as heavy lifting in the office, and more technical duties,
          such as database merging.
        </p>
        <p>
          One significant project involved merging the fall and winter
          databases. This project required us to explore and understand various
          API documentation for Infosilem Timetabler, as we initially lacked the
          knowledge to complete the task. Through extensive reading and
          learning, we successfully developed a solution to merge the databases.
          We did this by using SQL queries after several tries with other
          solutions. We were attempting to access the APIs but given the time
          constraints, we had to get creative and try other ways. All in all,
          I’m incredibly glad for the skills and experience we developed in the
          journey of trying to merge these two databases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I worked extensively with Python scripts to assist Tammy
          with various tasks. These included getting rid of duplicate entries
          and verifying the accuracy of registration numbers to ensure data
          integrity.

      <!-- Conclusions -->
      <section id="conclusions" class="mt-5">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          My co-op placement as a Scheduling Systems Support provided a valuable
          opportunity to develop both technical and professional skills.
          Collaborating with my co-op partner, Andrew, and assisting Tammy with
          various tasks also taught me the importance of teamwork and
          communication in a workplace setting. The valuable lessons I learned
          from the trial and error with the merging of the databases was
          priceless as myself and Andrew learned to stay composed, even when
          things weren’t working well and we managed to get the bulk of the
          project done in a relatively quick turnaround.

      <section id="acknowledgments" class="mt-5">
        <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
        <p>
          I would like to mention a massive thank you to both Tammy and Andrew
          throughout this recent Co-op term. This semester was different from
          the previous in the sense that I was now always working with someone
          else, and I found out how much I enjoy working and collaborating with
          others who are passionate about the same things I am.
